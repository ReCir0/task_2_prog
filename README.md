# The web-map project

The main goal was to create a mobule that generates a HTML file, which contains a map with at least three different layers. The user enteres a year, coordinates of the location(films are found using it) and a file where to get information from. The programm calculates ten closest filming possitions and makes Markers out of it

# Problems I dealt with

## Reading a file

## Calculating distance and getting the ten films 

## Creating a map

# Conclusion

```python
import math
```
